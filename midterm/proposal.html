				<p>An ecosystem<br> (built with particle system, Perlin noise and physics library)</p>
			</div>
			<p style="text-align: left">
				I would like to implement a tiny ecosystem that has the following features:
				<br>
				- Cells in geometric shapes (circles and polygons) can walk around in a container (Perlin Noise).
				<br>
				- They become blue when they are more isolated, and they become red when they are more close to each other.
				<br>
				- They have a great chance to die if they are too dense or too isolated.
				<br>
				- When two cells are close enough they can merge to one and grow bigger.
				<br>
				- When they get big enough they will have a chance to explode and become many basic cells,
				<br>
				or they will have a chance to evolve into a stronger type of cell.
				<br>
				(which has more sides and moves slower but has a less chance to die)
				<br><br>
				- The player can add new basic cells by mouse click and add a ripple effect to the system.
				<br>
				- The player can also drag the cells around.
				<br>
				- When a cell is dragged, the game is paused.
