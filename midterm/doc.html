        ABOUT THIS PROJECT:<br>
        <br>
        The final version of my midterm project becomes a tiny glass tank with many little cells in it.<br>
        Basically, this is a program that makes you feel like you are watching a minimal version of jellyfish tank, and makes you relax through its sound and vision.<br>
        These little cells are born in a very small size and they are able to merge bigger.<br>
        All the cells behave like a noise walker, so they are all moving naturally and independently in the system.<br>
        The color of the cell gets darker according to the density around it.<br>
        Small cells can go very fast in order to have a greater chance to grow, while the larger ones are extremely slow.<br>
        When a cell get large enough, it will burst and give birth to several tiny cells. In this way, the tank is able to maintain the balance itself.<br>
        <br>

        CONTROLS:<br>
        <br>
        However, as the system runs, the cells may become less and less as they might die more.<br>
        You can add new cells into the tank by clicking the mouse and shaking you hand with Leap Motion!<br>
        You can also drag the cells to other place if some parts of the tank get too crowded.<br>

        PROCESS & CHALLENGES:<br>
        <br>
        The whole project looks very different than I described in the proposal. This is mainly because I found there is much more limitations than I thought using a physical library.<br>
        For instance, I was planned to have different shapes of cells and color them in different hues of color. <br>
        Unfortunately, the fill method in fisica classes seems not to support HSB mode as well as tint(), which means if I attach an image to an object I am not able to change its color and I can only set the colors with RGB.<br>
        I was intended to use FCompound to make complex shaped, but I give it up because it is not appealing and needs too much works.<br>
        <br>
        Also because all the objects are built with Fisica, it actually becomes hard to update the cells and change the attributes according to different situation.<br>
        I spent a lot of time reading the documentation fo Fisica, and realized that I have to expend the class of FBody, which I never done before. Thankfully, this was easier that I thought and it gave me much freedom on customizing my objects.<br>
        <br>
        The other challenge I met is the sound effect. Initially, in order to make multiple sound effects, an AudioPlayer was created each time when the cell burst.<br>
        But this led to extreme memory use and almost froze the whole program after a certain amount of time. <br>
        This finally got fixed by using AudioSample instead of AudioPlayer. For each time a burst happens, it will only need to trigger the sample but won't load and store the sound file again.<br>
        <br>
        For me, the largest take-away of this project is, the libraries may significantly save your code, but they may also make you do much extra work.
